*"Go out for a walk. And yeah, you need not have multiple life epiphanies along the way."*

My name is Devyansh Chawla. Iâ€™m an undergraduate at National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra, India pursuing Bachelor of
Technology in Information Technology.

I'm a full-stack developer who loves to solve real-world problems through software engineering. I've gained proficiency in JavaScript and acquired some experience in Computer Vision which I intend to widen.
