### Summary of the third report

In the past two weeks,  I have worked on Mission 4 of The Userscript Tour i.e. Novelty of OOUI.

Mission 4 makes users familiar with Object-Oriented User Interface, how to easily create user interfaces with OOUI, and  how to write userscripts using OOUI. This mission required comparatively less effort due to the following two reasons:
1. Since I have already worked on three Missions, I am getting the hang of relevant design elements and concepts to be incorporated in Missions. **Huge credit goes to my awesome mentors <3**
2. Most importantly, during the Community Bonding Period, I dived deeper into Object-Oriented User Interface (OOUI). I came to appreciate the library's very idea and thus found it easier to include stuff that **should** be told to new developers getting started with OOUI.

### Pages created on MediaWiki
- TUT/4/Start
- TUT/Badge/4
- TUT/Badge/4template
- TUT/Badge/4template1
- TUT/4/End

### Userscripts created 
- **showAlertBox.js:** Appends an OOUI button to the portlet area which, when clicked, shows an OOUI Message Dialog (a simple alert box).

- **guessRandomNumber.js:** One of the cool userscripts which makes use of custom widgets. It appends a tiny random game at the bottom of the wiki page. The OOUI widgets used are: *MessageWidget, LabelWidget, TextInputWidget, ButtonWidget and Simple Message Dialog Box.*
