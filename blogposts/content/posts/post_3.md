Do mention the following experience:
1. You decided to use OO.ui.alert instead of normal browser alert to conform with WikimediaUI. However, the OOUI alert and OOUI message dialog were always beneath the guider! I ditched OO.ui.alert and decided to go for OO.ui.MessageDialog as it provided more flexibility in terms of APIs and properties available.

I increased the z-index of this message dialog to get the top overlay...
